<h2 style="text-align: left;">Course Overview</h2>
<p class="blue"><strong><em>GPS for Mariners</em></strong> (GPSFM) is a modern learning experience that focuses on the GPS equipment typically owned by the recreational boater. This course is the result of an exciting synergy between textbook's publisher, the book's author, and the Auxiliary.</p>
<p class="blue">The recommended presentation of the course involves inviting course participants who already own hand-held GPS units to bring them to the class, increasing interactivity of the educational experience and getting students more involved.</p>
<p class="blue">However, this class is so effective that even those not possessing handheld units will learn how to use a GPS for practical recreational boating.</p>
