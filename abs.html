South Carolina law requires a person under 16 years of age to pass a boating safety course approved by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources or be accompanied by an adult at least 18 years old who is not under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs in order to operate a vessel powered by 15 horsepower or more.

Even if not required by law to get the South Carolina boating license, many boaters take the boat safety course in order to save on their PWC or boat insurance.
